# Spotify-House-Party
This project is done for the purpose of learning Django, React and other full-stack web application development knowledge such as HTTP requests, API calling, and the OAuth2.0 process.

## What this app does
This is a full-stack music controller web app that allows users to connect to their Spotify account, create a room for playing music as a host. Others can join the room as guests and listen to music together. They may be able to pause or play the current song depending on the settings of that room. They will also be able to vote on whether to skip the current song or not, if the vote exceeds a certain threshold set by the host, the current song will be skipped.
